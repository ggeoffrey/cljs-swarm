## Simple swarm intelligence simulation

> Hook: She told him stories. He taught her to fly. How?  
> Wendy: You just think happy thoughts. They lift you into the air.  
> Hook: Alas, I have no happy thoughts.  
> Wendy: That brings you down!  
> Hook: [Hook threatens to cut Wendy's throat with his hook] How else?  
> Michael: Fairy dust! You need fairy dust!  

Made with the almighty [Clojure](http://clojure.org/index), our Tinker Bell; and [ThreeJS](http://threejs.org/).

###Curious ?

Start with `src/swarm/core.cljs`. I tryed to be explicit and to write elegant Clojure code, to make things easy for you. If it's too blurry or dirty don't hesitate to let me know by e-mail or open an issue.

**Disclaimer**
- *Code is not 100% perfect.*
- Their isn't fairy dust in the code, but you might encounter someponies. Be cautious.
